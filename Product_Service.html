                    <p>Fresh, home-made and simple is the Full of Bologna message.  The current popularity of fresh and healthy eating is 
                        exciting for customers.  Our low-carb, low-fat or no-fat and low-calorie offerings, such as our gourmet vegetarian 
                        lasagna, will be stunning and amazing while offering full and robust flavor.  This is in keeping with the number one 
                        trend cited by the National Restaurant Association (NRA) 2005 Report.  We also will key in on high flavor, bold and 
                        spicy tones as cited as the number three trend. The number two is Ethnic food so Italian remains at the top.</p>

                        <br>
                    <p>Our specialty Italian and Mediterranean sandwiches, like the famous Italian Huge Plate Muffelata, will be home run 
                        hits across the board.  Our hand-made breads fresh from the kitchen will astound diners when they accompany meals and 
                        as sandwiches.  Our previous successes with Salami, Provolone and Italian Style Ham and Balsamic Vinegar/Olive Oil 
                        Remoulade Wrap or our Fried Chicken Caesar Wrap will meet with the NRA’s predicted desires for “wraps” cited under hot 
                        trend number six–gourmet sandwiches, and nine–wraps.  We also showcase an exquisite hand-made demi roll with goat cheese 
                        and roasted peppers and vegetables.  This mini sandwich is served with fresh sliced pomodoro tomatoes and crisp Boston or 
                        Romaine lettuce.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Hot trend items number seven–seafood, and eight–comfort foods will also be addressed with our wonderful fish and seafood 
                        dishes that play into exotic spice and flavor profiles.  Some examples of these include our Spinach Stuffed, Fresh Atlantic 
                        Flounder with Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce and Pesto Dots.  We stuff this with our own hand reduced, fresh spinach leaves 
                        in a double chicken broth and then mix in Italian bread crumbs and lemon.  The heartiness of this dish plays towards the noted 
                        comfort foods cycle as does our Huge Italian Meatballs (baseball sized) over Spaghetti, Handmade Po Valley Oven Meatloaf with 
                        Tomato Sauce and Garlic Mashed Potatoes or Prosciutto and Peas in Fresh Cream over Spinach Linguini.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Our food products will be fresh and of the finest quality, prepared with sensitivity and care on the premises. Full of Bologna 
                        will change the “specials” on the menu every 3-4 months, but we’ll keep ‘Your Favorites.’ </p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Our wine list will be modest in size and primarily focused on wines from Italy, France and California.  Approximately 25% will 
                        be exclusively available by the glass and the remaining labels will be available by the bottle.</p>
                        <br> 
                    <p>We will also feature a moderate international beer selection on tap and in bottles.  These will be exclusively dominated by 
                        Belgian and Italian beers.  We will develop our own micro brewery, offering several of our own beers.  The comfortable softly-lit bar 
                        features a comprehensive selection of the finest Vodkas, homemade Italian apertifs and digestifs (like Lemoncello) and single malt 
                        Scotches as well as all of the other favorites.  We will offer a number of Campari specialties. </p>
                        <br> 
                    <p>During the busy summer months customers can also sit outside on our patio and we will offer a special summer menu, featuring lighter 
                        fare, exotic drinks, and non-alcoholic offerings.  The patio and garden setting will be a fun and casual atmosphere for the summer crowd. </p>
                        <br>    
                    <p>We will offer a three course ‘business lunch’ prix fixe and a three course dinner prix fixe in addition to the regular menu. 
                        We will be open 7 days a week serving lunch Monday – Friday 10:30 AM – 2:30 PM and dinner Sunday – Thursday, between 5 PM – 10 PM. 
                        Friday and Saturday Dinner 5 PM – 11 PM.  The lounge will be open until 2 AM Friday and Saturday.  Sunday – Thursday the lounge will 
                        stay open till 12 AM.  Saturday and Sunday we will serve brunch between 11 AM – 3 PM.</P>
